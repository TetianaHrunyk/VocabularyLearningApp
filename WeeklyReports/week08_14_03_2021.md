<h2>Comments on the differences between <italic>Planned</italic> and <italic>Done</italic></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>As suggested by one of my teachers, I decided to use GitHub functionality, as it allows to keep things together</li>
        <li>The wireframes were created. So far they are very simple and their main purpose is to help to figure out what structure the project is supposed to have and what components I am going to need. In addition to that, when thinking of the visual part of the app, I got lots of insights into the functionality it is supposed to have, so I made notes on how different features should work</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>I found that the course is going to help me a lot to learn the basics, so that I would have less troubles when I get to the implementation part</li>
    </ol>
